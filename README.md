Abstractâ€”Coronary heart disease (CHD) is still a major 
health problem that affects a large number of people leading to 
death if not detected and treated in its early stages. In order to 
early detect CHD, variety of modern algorithms and techniques 
are presented such as data mining algorithms. Data mining is 
one of the richest and more popular areas of research in health 
organizations due to the availability of data within the health 
care system. This project aims at analyzing the various data 
mining algorithms that are introduced in recent few years for 
heart disease prediction. In this research project, the relation
ship between features, used in prediction of CHD, are studied 
and illustrated. 16 features are included in the study dataset 
where these features are reduced to 6 features, by feature 
selection algorithms extract the most important features that 
cause CHD among the total features which will be included in 
the study. Finally, the study indicates whether the patient is 
infected with CHD or not.
